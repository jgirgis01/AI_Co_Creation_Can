# **Code of Conduct**

This Code of Conduct is adapted from [Queer in AI](https://www.queerinai.com/code-of-conduct).

## **Our Commitment**

The Queering AI Co-Creation Project is dedicated to fostering a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code applies to all spaces, both online and offline. Any person who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the Queer in AI Safety Team.

Our project is centered around the experiences of 2SLGBTQIA+ people. We aim to co-create a project that addresses issues in AI impacting the queer community, acknowledging that queer identities are multifaceted and intersectional.

## **Expectations of Participants**

We ask all participants in our spaces to:

- Exercise consideration and respect in both speech and actions.
- Listen as much as you speak.
- Make an effort to understand and learn from individuals with different backgrounds.
- Avoid making assumptions about others.
- Attempt collaboration before resorting to conflict.
- Recognize that everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
- Prioritize the input of marginalized groups in AI spaces.

## **Anti-Harassment Policy**

We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, skill set, appearance, body size, race, age, nationality, citizenship status, religion, or any other aspect of identity. Harassment is not tolerated, and includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to any personal characteristic.
- Unwelcome remarks about lifestyle choices (e.g., food, health, employment).
- Deliberate misgendering or refusal to use correct names/pronouns.
- Gender binarism or biological essentialism.
- "Outing" any personal aspect of someone’s identity without consent.
- Threats of violence or incitement of violence.
- Harassment through sustained disruption, stalking, or inappropriate social contact.

Queer in AI prioritizes the safety of marginalized people over the comfort of privileged individuals. We will not act on complaints regarding "reverse"-isms (e.g., reverse racism, reverse sexism) or reasonable communication of boundaries.

## **Reporting Harassment**

If you are being harassed, notice harassment, or have any concerns, please contact [Jackie](mailto:queering.ai.canada@gmail.com).

In cases of harassment by Jackie, or if you'd prefer to handle matters outside this project, you can contact the funder, [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en)).

If you are being harassed outside of project spaces, we still want to hear from you. We take harassment seriously, even if it occurs outside of our spaces or at a different time.

## **Consequences of Violating the Code of Conduct**

Participants who are asked to stop harassing behavior must comply immediately. If harassment continues, the individual may be banned from future meetings or activities. Repeated offenses or severe actions may lead to public notification, including alerts to AI conference organizers.

We also reserve the right to reject reports made in bad faith and to protect victims of abuse by keeping reports confidential when necessary.

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

This Code of Conduct is a living document and will be revised annually by the community. The latest update was made on **December 16, 2024**.
