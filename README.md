# **2SLGBTQIA+ AI Co-Creation Project (EDIA DRI Funding)**

## **Mission**
Our mission is to empower 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals to understand how AI impacts their lives. We aim to co-create a project that incorporates the unique experiences and challenges faced by the community, offering practical tools and knowledge to navigate AI technologies and their impact.

## **Vision**
We envision a community of 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals who are equipped with knowledge and tools to understand and manage AI's impact on their everyday lives. Together, we will co-create an accessible project that fosters collaboration and offers solutions based on the diverse perspectives of our community.

### **Purpose**
This project addresses the increasing influence of AI in our daily lives, particularly how it affects the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. By empowering individuals to understand these technologies, we hope to create a more informed, proactive community. Our work explores how AI shapes our interactions, choices, and society, while providing strategies to manage and mitigate any negative impact.

### **Project Overview**
This project is structured in three key parts:

1. **Initial Meetings & Discussions**: We will gather 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals to discuss what topics are important in terms of AI, how it impacts their lives, and how to structure a training program that reflects these concerns.
2. **Training Delivery**: The second phase focuses on delivering a comprehensive training program that will address the topics identified during the meetings, providing participants with valuable knowledge and skills on understanding AI and its impacts.
3. **Co-Creation of a Project**: In the final phase, participants will collaborate to co-create a project that incorporates their insights, addressing AI's impact from a queer perspective and offering practical tools or solutions.

### **Target Audience**
- **Users**: 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals who are interested in understanding how AI affects their day-to-day life.
- **Contributors**: Those with an interest in co-creating a project that includes diverse perspectives on AI, particularly within the 2SLGBTQIA+ context.

### **How It Works**
Our project focuses on co-creating a collaborative tool/resource with the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. We aim to develop educational content, workshops, and resources that help people understand AI in an accessible and relatable way. Participants will work together to shape the project, ensuring that it reflects the unique experiences of queer individuals.
